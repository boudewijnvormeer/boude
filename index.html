                        12 Rules for Investing in Someone Else's Business</strong></font></p>
                      <p>Here are twelve basic rules to use when considering an 
                        investment in a small business:</p>
                      <p><b>1. Don't be &quot;sold&quot; investments.</b></p>
                      <p>You select your investments. Don't blindly accept a friend's 
                        or family member's pitch. If you haven't established your 
                        own investment goals, do not invest in anything until 
                        you do so. Without your own goals or standards, you lack 
                        a basis for assessing the opportunity. You leave yourself 
                        vulnerable to the sales pitch that sounds good. </p>
                      <p>Only get into investments that meet your criteria. Check 
                        out the business plan yourself. If you do not have the 
                        ability to review the business plan, get help from someone 
                        who does.</p>
                      <p><b>2. Require a business plan.</b></p>
                      <p>Insist on seeing the business plan of anyone proposing 
                        that you invest in his or her business. Never even consider 
                        an investment without a business plan. The business plan 
                        should provide enough detail for you to determine whether 
                        the business is feasible and is likely to succeed. It 
                        should make clear how the business will make money and 
                        provide a return on investment to investors.</p>
                      <p><b>3. Calculate your downside risk.</b></p>
                      <p>Determine what the various outcomes might be. Under what 
                        circumstances will the business succeed? Under what circumstances 
                        will it fail? What is needed for the business to break 
                        even? If the business needs more money at some point, 
                        will that money be available or will the business fail 
                        for lack of additional cash? Will you be willing to refuse 
                        to provide additional funding and see the business collapse?</p>
                      <p>Do not accept any representation that &quot;that can't 
                        happen.&quot; Determine for yourself what can happen. 
                        Can you afford to lose your entire investment? Will any 
                        assets be left for you if the business fails?</p>
                      <p><b>4. Consider tax consequences.</b></p>
                      <p>What are the tax consequences of this investment? Can 
                        this investment be structured to provide a tax benefit 
                        to you if it fails? Will the investment be a purchase 
                        of stock in a small corporation under IRC 1244, allowing 
                        you to get ordinary loss treatment on the sale of the 
                        stock or failure of the business?</p>
                      <p>If the investment is structured as a loan, remember that 
                        a loss on a loan to a business is treated by the IRS as 
                        a non-business loss. Unless this capital loss can be utilized 
                        to offset capital gains you have from other investments, 
                        the maximum capital loss which can be deducted from your 
                        ordinary income is $3,000 per year.</p>
                      <p>Is the entity an S corporation, LLC, or other pass-through 
                        entity? If so, remember that the tax consequences will 
                        be passed through to you. These tax consequences can be 
                        profits, losses, capital gains, etc. Make sure you can 
                        deal with these tax consequences.</p>
                      <p>You may find that you can't take advantage of losses 
                        because they are passive losses, which can only be used 
                        to offset passive income which you may not have. </p>
                      <p>Another potential problem is being taxed on profits that 
                        are not distributed. In a pass-through entity you are 
                        taxed on your portion of the taxable income, whether or 
                        not any cash has been distributed to you. </p>
                      <p>Can you afford to be taxed on undistributed profits? 
                        If profits are reinvested in the business there may be 
                        no cash to distribute to the investors who must pay the 
                        taxes. </p>
                      <p><b>5. Use your influence.</b></p>
                      <p>Get what is best for you. Have the investment structured 
                        the way you want it, or don't invest. Are you a key investor? 
                        Are you the only financial backer? If you are just one 
                        of several investors, what power will you have to influence 
                        the management of the business?</p>
                      <p>Don't overestimate the value of the founder's management 
                        contribution or underestimate the value of your financial 
                        contribution. Without your money, the founder may have 
                        nothing. Without the founder, you would still have your 
                        money and you would find another investment.</p>
                      <p>Have the investment structured to give you the control 
                        you need to protect your investment. If your investment 
                        is an equity investment, make sure you have the voting 
                        power you need, and protection from dilution of voting 
                        power. </p>
                      <p>Have the ability to elect the number of directors necessary 
                        to control the Board of Directors, or at least have veto 
                        power over certain actions by the Board. Don't fall for 
                        the idea that the founder should have control of the business. 
                      </p>
                      <p>Do you prefer to provide a loan, instead of buying stock? 
                        A loan is intended to be paid back with interest whether 
                        the business does well or not. If the loan is to an entity, 
                        which might cease to exist, insist on a personal guarantee. 
                        Make sure the loan is secured by the most valuable assets 
                        of the business, and by assets of the guarantors.</p>
                      <p><b>6. Make sure the founders also have something to lose.</b></p>
                      <p>Don't get into a business where the founders have nothing 
                        to lose. Make sure the founders will lose money or end 
                        up in debt if the business fails. The fear of failure 
                        should motivate them even when the possibility of success 
                        does not.</p>
                      <p>The business needs to have incentives and disincentives 
                        for management and the founders. Otherwise, they may be 
                        willing to operate a worthless business as long as your 
                        money provides income to them.</p>
                      <p><b>7. Do it right.</b></p>
                      <p>Make sure your paperwork is in order, even if you are 
                        investing in the business of a friend. Check to see if 
                        any of your rights as an investor must be covered in the 
                        articles of incorporation in order to be valid. If necessary, 
                        have the articles of incorporation amended.</p>
                      <p>Be sure to file your security interests in the right 
                        places. If any of the assets to be used as collateral 
                        are trademarks, patents, or copyrights, the security interests 
                        must be filed with the appropriate federal offices. While 
                        most security interests in assets are filed with the Secretary 
                        of State, you must check the filing requirements for the 
                        different types of assets you use as collateral.</p>
                      <p>If you are providing significant funding for a business, 
                        you should insist on other rights which go beyond collateral. 
                        You should have the right to receive financial reports 
                        on a regular basis, to inspect the books and the facility, 
                        and to audit the financial status of the company.</p>
                      <p><b>8. Get it in writing.</b></p>
                      <p>Cover all important aspects of your arrangement in the 
                        written documents. Don't rely on oral promises or general 
                        trust.</p>
                      <p><b>9. Keep copies of all documents.</b></p>
                      <p>Don't forget to keep copies of all paperwork for the 
                        entity. For a corporation, keep copies of minutes, bylaws, 
                        articles of incorporation, and shareholder agreements. 
                        For partnerships and limited liability companies, keep 
                        copies of the agreements which establish the entity. Keep 
                        copies of all filings with the Secretary of State and 
                        the IRS. Keep the original notes on your loans in a safe 
                        place.</p>
                      <p><b>10. Plan to get money out.</b></p>
                      <p>How will you get money out of the business? Will you 
                        be an employee? Will you spend enough time on the business 
                        to justify the income you want? Will you be paid consulting 
                        fees? Will you want dividends paid? Do you need to elect 
                        S corporation status as a basis for distribution of profits 
                        to you?</p>
                      <p><b>11. Don't invest money that you can't afford to lose.</b></p>
                      <p>Don't invest money you need access to. Many investments 
                        in small businesses are completely illiquid. Even if the 
                        business survives and does well, your funds may be tied 
                        up until a major event frees up your money (and the major 
                        event may never happen). Don't invest in a business where 
                        your only &quot;out&quot; is an initial public offering.</p>
                      <p><b>12. Invest responsibly.</b></p>
                      <p>Even if you can afford to lose the money, and even if 
                        the beneficiary of your investment is your child, don't 
                        be reckless. Require even your child's business to meet 
                        high standards of business planning. Irresponsible investing 
                        encourages irresponsible business management. A business 
                        out of control is a poor investment for you and a poor 
                        training ground for your child.</p>
